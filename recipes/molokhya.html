        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Molokhia, is an amazing Mediterranean dish made by cooking minced Jute leaves in broth. There are various ways to prepare Molokhia; today, I will prepare the most famous one, which is the Egyptian way using a homemade chicken broth. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Let the Molokhia defrost at room temperature.</li>
                <li>In a skillet, heat the oil over medium heat, then add the minced garlic, stir until it has a  golden colour. Add the dry coriander and saut√© with the garlic for 30 seconds.</li>
